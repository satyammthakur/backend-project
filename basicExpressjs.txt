-- This is basic express js code in which we learnt that how we can write same cde that we wrote
in the http portion with so lengthy code , express js came in picture and trim it down 
topics- 1. adding middlewares and handling diff routes .

handling routes mein one thing that you have to remember is for '/' we have to write in the last
else it won't work properly.

const express = require("express");

const app = express();

app.use('/',(req,res,next)=>{
    console.log("hemlo doston");
    next();
});

app.use('/users',(req,res,next)=>{
    console.log(" doston users hai");
    res.send('<ul><li>satyam</li> <li>satyam2</li> <li>satyam3</li> <li>satyam4</li></ul>')
});

app.use('/',(req,res,next)=>{
    console.log("hi doston");
    res.send("<h1>hello</h1>")
});

app.listen(3000);
